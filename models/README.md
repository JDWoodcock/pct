# Models of potential level of cycling and extra cycling potential

This folder contains scripts to run models which calculate 'propensity to cycle'
(more formally defined as extra cycling potential (*ECP*)).

Aggregate and individual-level models, amongst other are included.

These models increase in complexity with their number.
