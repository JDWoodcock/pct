To estimate the relative health/carbon benefits of different scenarios of
behavioural change in the transport sector we use a multilevel model
based on the National Travel Survey (NTS) which provides information at
the regional, household, trip and stage level. The method could be used to
assess the impacts of a wide range of future scenarios. In this paper
we focus on the impacts of cycling uptake under a range of assumptions
about the types of people who are most likely to start cycling.

The method builds on @Crawford2014 but instead of predetermining model outcomes
by fixing the final rate of cycling, each different scenario is based on
different parameters determining *distance decay*. @Crawford used a very
simple formula for distance decay and did not optimise the parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$
