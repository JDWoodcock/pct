- **The rate of cycling** is the measure of cycling activity. It can be measured
  in terms of the number of regular cyclists (*NC*) --- such as the number who regularly
  cycle to work (*NC~commute~*) or the number who would classify themselves as
  leisure cyclists (*NC~leisure~*) --- or in terms of the number of trips per year
  or week (*NT~yr~* or *NT~wk~*).
  
- **Propensity to cycle** (*PC*) is the *expected* rate of cycling in given area or between
  origin-destination pairs. This propensity is calculated using a model and can
  incorporate the impact of socio-demographic variables on willingness to cycle
  long distances (i.e. see *distance decay*, below), the predicted influence of
  the transport network (e.g. *circuity* and the presence of dedicated cycle paths)
  and other place-specific variables.
  
- **Extra cycling potential** (*ECP*) is the number of additional trips or cyclists
  that can be expected in a given scenario of the future. Formally, this can be 
  defined as the expected rate of cycling (under a set of assumptions) minus
  the current rate of cycling. For the number of people who regularly cycle to work,
  for example, *ECP* would be defined as follows:
  
$$
ECP_{commute} = PC_{commute} - NC_{commute}
$$

- Note that *ECP* can also be defined as a fraction, showing the percentage increase
  in cycling following a particular policy intervention. We can call this 
  **proportional increase in cycling** (*PIC*):
  
$$
PIC = \frac{PC}{NC}
$$
  
- **Distance decay** (*DD*) is function that relates the distance (*d*) of a trip to
  the probability of it being made by a specific mode of travel (e.g. by bicycle) with
  respect to predefined set of explanatory variables (*X*)
  such as the person's socio-demographic group and the hilliness of the local area.
  
$$
DD = f(d, X)
$$

- **Circuity** ($Q$) is the actual length of a trip along the transport network compared
    with the straight-line (*Euclidean*) distance. Formally,
    
$$
Q = \frac{d_{R}}{d_{E}}
$$
